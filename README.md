# Tamaghosty  
You killed your Tamagotchi at age 8, and now...  
 It's BACK!*   
*To take care of you! (Just, try not to kill it – again ...)   
   
Introducing Tamaghosty! Having grown up (and been resurrected), you now know that caring for each other is just as important.   

## Inspiration:  
I was inspired to create this project after reading through the Kiroween Hackathon Submission guidelines. As this was my first Hackathon (and first solo Hackathon) I wanted to make sure that I fully understood the entry and judging criteria.
### From the [Kiroween Webpage:](https://kiro.dev/blog/kiroween-2025/)  

"The challenge is to build a working app using Kiro, inspired by a set of spooky categories to get you in the Halloween spirit. We wanted to keep these open-ended so you can build what excites you the most, and inspiring enough to bring out some really cool and unique app ideas:
- **Resurrection:** Bring your favorite dead technology back to life. Reimagine obsolete tech with today’s innovations or solving tomorrow's problems.
- **Frankenstein:** Stitch together a chimera of technologies into one app. Bring together seemingly incompatible elements to build something unexpectedly powerful.
- **Skeleton Crew:** Build a skeleton code template lean enough to be clear but flexible enough to support various use cases. Show us its versatility with two distinct applications from your foundation.
- **Costume Contest:** Build any app but show us a haunting user interface that’s polished and unforgettable. Bring in spooky design elements that enhance your app’s function.
- **Start-up:** We’ve added a new prize category for Kiroween that awards $10,000 to the Best Startup Project. We want to provide startup founders a chance to rapidly prototype and develop concepts that would typically require significantly more resources. Kiro's ability to accelerate development cycles means you can test more ambitious ideas, with faster iterations, and emerge with a compelling product —all within the hackathon timeframe.  

<u>**Judging Criteria**</u>:
- **Potential Value:** How useful, accessible, and impactful is your solution?
- **Implementation:** How effectively did you leverage Kiro's capabilities?
- **Quality and Design:** How creative, original, and polished is your project?

<u>**Submission Requirements**</u>: 
- You'll need to provide your public code repository with the .kiro directory (showing how you used specs, hooks, and steering), a functional application URL, a 3-minute demonstration video, and documentation on how you utilized Kiro throughout your development process that shows us your next-level understanding of its features, such as:
  - **Vibe coding:** How did you structure your conversations with Kiro to build your project? What was the most impressive code generation Kiro helped you with?
  - **Agent hooks:** What specific workflows did you automate with Kiro hooks? How did these hooks improve your development process?
  - **Spec-driven development:** How did you structure your spec for Kiro to implement? How did the spec-driven approach improve your development process? How did this compare to vibe coding?
  - **Steering docs:** How did you leverage steering to improve Kiro’s responses? Was there a particular strategy that made the biggest difference?
  - **MCP:** How did extending Kiro’s capabilities help you build your project? What sort of features or workflow improvements did MCP enable that otherwise would have been difficult or impossible?
 
Kiroween was designed for Kiro developers as a fun opportunity to experiment with Kiro and leverage the full gamut of features and capabilities it offers. This is your moment to create something unforgettable. Get inspired by Kiroween’s special spooky factor, summon your ideas, and git commit to the darkness."  
  
I decided rather arbitrarily that the Ressurection and Costume Contest categories would be the most enjoyable for me, and then spent about a week agonising over what to choose. Originally I had the idea to recreate Flappy Bird but with a more spooky theme, however as I'll be attending The HackSussex GameJam soon, I decided to steer clear of anything video game related.   
  

## Why I beleive Tamaghosty fits into three categories:
- **Resurrection:** This is a more obvious category to argue, as Tamaghosty is simply a re-imagining of Tamagotchi (but with real-world applications relevant to student life).
- **Costume Contest:** I spent a lot of time on the aesthetics of this app. I love horror movies due to how much detail and how many easter eggs they add into the backgrounds of scenes, and I wanted to emulate this in the Tamaghosty home screen (watch out for strange movements).
- **Frankenstein:** The idea of re-imagining also plays into the Frankenstein category. Whilst Tamaghosty (the Tamagotchi re-imagining) is still interactive, I joined it with the idea of a self-care and study app as this is generally a combination I don't seem to find. I'm a student, so in my opinion self-care and studying should go hand-in hand. This app combines a re-imagined Tamagotchi (Tamaghosty), a study timer, a hydration tracker, a meal tracker, guided mindfulness and breathing exercises, and a journal with journalling promts.

## App Features:
- **Home Screen:**
  - Icon = Tamaghosty grave stone (TG)
  - Health bar in the corner that refreshes at 12am
  - AI generated art that appears as if it's moving!
  - Trails of mist...
  - Eyes in the darkness
  - Wait, is the Scarecrow moving?
  - CSS flying creatures
  - **Tamaghosty Home Screen Features:**
    - Tamaghosty glows different colours depending in Health status (1-2 activities = no glow, 3-4 activities = purple glow, 5+ activities = yellow glow)
    - Tamaghosty will glow red when annoyed
    - Tamaghosty can fall asleep! Tap to wake them up!
    - Hitting is a feature I have retained from Tamagotchi (as so many people found it funny), so you can hit Tamaghosty and make them angry (glows red)
    - Tamaghosty wants to eat your cursor! (They're just so hungry!)
    - Tamaghosty will follow your cursor with hungry eyes (tap screen to stop eye tracking, then tap a second time to re-initiate)
    - Tamaghosty Blinks!
    - Tamaghosty speaks when interacted with
- **Study Zone:**
  - 25, 45 and 60 minute study timers
  - A cute little Tamaghosty that winks!
  - The stopwatch mode records time spent studying, and Tamaghosty tells you how long this was (they're the ultimate cheerleader)
  - After stop watch/timer finishes, confetti explodes and you are congratulated!
